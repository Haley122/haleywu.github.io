Over the past years, we have established collaborations with various research teams and industry partners to implement our DOFS systems across multiple fields.
#### 1. Leveraging Optical Communication Fiber and AI for Distributed Water Pipe Leak Detection
Detecting leaks in water networks is a costly challenge. We collaborated with the Hydraulics research group at PolyU introduced a solution - the integration of an optical network that uses  fiber-optic cable measure vibrations, enabling accurate leak detection and localization by an intelligent algorithm. We also prpose a method to assess leak severity for prioritized repairs. Our solution is capable of detecting even small leaks with a folow rate as low as 0.027 L/s, offering a cost-effective way to improving leak detection, enhancing water management, and optimizing operational efficiency.
