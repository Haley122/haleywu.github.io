My research focuses on the field of distributed optical fiber sensors (DOFSs) and their applications. I am interested in developing new optical fiber-based monitoring technologies. The development of new DOFSs involves a combination of advanced interrogation schemes (modulation and demodulation parts), utilizing specialty optical fibers, and designing transducers.
Moreover, I am actively engaged in exploring data-driven signal processing methods to effectively leverage the data collected from fiber-optic-based sensors. My overarching goal is to make meaningful advancements in this area and harness the full potential of light and optical fiber, thereby creating intelligent and superior sensing solutions.

### <ins>Distributed optical fiber sensing technologies</ins>     
In my research, I have focused on exploring the following three distributed optical fiber sensors.

#### 1. Distributed acoustic sensor (DAS)
The working principle of DAS is based on the phase-sensitive OTDR that utilizes the interference effect of Rayleigh backscattering of different scatters within the pulse width. A DAS prototype that can realize real-time vibration sensing along 30 km optical fiber was built in our lab. Check out the basic principle of DAS [here] ()

#### 2. Distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS)     
The working principle of DTSS is based on the stimulated Brillouin scattering that utilizes the linear relationship of Brillouin frequency shift and temperature/strain. A DTSS system that can realize temperature/strain sensing along 50 km optical fiber was built in our lab.Check out the basic principle of DTSS [here] ()

#### 3. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS)     
The working principle of DTS is based on Raman scattering, which utilizes the relationship between Stokes and anti-Stokes intensities and temperature. In our lab, we have built a DTS system capable of realizing temperature sensing along a 10 km optical fiber in our lab. Check out the basic principle of DTS [here] ()
