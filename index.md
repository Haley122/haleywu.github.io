I am a research assistant professor in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/) at [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). 

I received a B.Eng degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2013 and a Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018, respectively. I was a post-doc research fellow in the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) from 2018 to 2020 and in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI), PolyU from 2020 to 2022. 

My current research interests include distributed optical fiber sensors and their applications.

In my spare time, I enjoy waterside long runs, hiking, and yoga. Welcome to check out my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/100939052) ðŸ˜‰
