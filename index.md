I am a research assistant professor in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/) at [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). 

I received the B.Eng degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2013 and Ph.D. degree from the Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2018, respectively. I was a post-doc research fellow in Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), the Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristy (PolyU) from 2018 to 2020 and in Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI), PolyU from 2020 to 2022.
